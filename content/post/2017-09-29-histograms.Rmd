Simply put, a histogram is a graph that uses vertical bars to visualize data amounts. In class, we worked on making a histogram that showed body weights for baseball players, having 50 bars shown on our graph.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT weight
FROM Master"

result<-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="green",fill="white",bins=50)+
  ggtitle("Body Weight Distribution for Baseball Players")
```
